# ParkingProblem

A parking problem application :)

# Creating a parking lot

In order to create a parking lot you just need to run the main class "parkingLotStart.java". This will also run an example of the cars from a list (given in the Data input below)

# Data input

Please find the example input in the "examples" folder. The data is read line by line, where each line presents the type of the car, whether the car goes in or out,what the amount of money the person has and number of hours the person stays. In case the person cannot pay the rate, there will be an "alarm" set off.

- ex. CarList ["FiftyKW In 20 2", "TwentyKW In 30", "Twenty Out 500 10"]

# Tools used

Plain Java was used for this project.
