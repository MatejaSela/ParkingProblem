# ParkingProblem

A parking problem application :)

# Creating a parking lot

In order to create a parking lot you just need to run the main class "parkingLotStart.java". This will also run an example of the cars from a list (given in the Data input below)

# Data input

Please find the example input in the ParkingLotStart class, while the Car class represents the type of the car, whether the car goes in or out,what the amount of money the person has and number of hours the person stayed. In case the person cannot pay the rate, there will be an "alarm" set off.

- ex. Car
  String carType = FiftyKW
  Double moneyToPayFees = 20
  Integer hoursStayedAtParkingLot = 0
  Boolean enteringTheLot = true

After some time the car will exit the lot and the hoursStayedAtParkingLot will change accordingly.

# Tools used

Plain Java was used for this project.
